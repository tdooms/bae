# Bilinear Autoencoders

This is the official repository for the paper "[finding manifolds with bilinear autoencoders](ref)".

## Setup

This repo uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). The setup should be as easy as installing it and running:

```bash
uv sync
```

## Autoencoders

The meat of the repo, pending some rewrites and documentation.
I also have a subfolder ``experimental`` which contains some semi-working versions for quick iterations.

## Workspace

I usually use two repos; one scientific and one cleaned up version.
I'm experimenting with just having the one, where I also openly keep my working files, which is this folder.
These are extremely messy and probably won't contain any valuable insights.

## Tutorials

Upon request (or whim), I'll add tutorials here. Please [reach out](https://tdooms.github.io/) if you have any ideas or suggestions (have a low threshold to do this).

## Figures

Reproduce any figure from the paper quickly.

## Utils

Additional functions and classes that I often needed.
